Question1: Which of the two programs, Program1 and Program2, has best performance, or are the
performance of the two programs about the same?
Program 2 have better performance


Question2: Is there any difference in which order different work tasks are performed in the two
different solutions, Program1 and Program2?
In program1 a loop is used to run the three different tasks (download, analyze, categorize) until all webpages are moved to the last queue (ToPrintQueue)
Each thread performs one task at a time and move the webpage to the next queue to be picked up from that queue by a thread
The download "task" picks up (If there is a webpage in the toDownLoadQueue) one webpage from the toDownloadQueue and downloads the webpage
and put it in the next queue (toAnalyzequeue). The analyze "task" picks up one webpage from the ToAnalyzeQueue (If there is a webpage in the
ToAnalyzeQueue) and perform the analysis of the webpage and put it in the ToCategorizeQueue. The Categorize "task" pick up one webpage from
the toCategorizeQueue (If there is a webpage in the toCategorizequeue) and categorize the webpage and put it in the Toprintqueue.
If not all the web pages have arrived in the toPrintqueue the loop run one more turn. until all webpages are in the toprintQueue.
Program 2 each thread pick up an webpage from the toDownloadQueue and process all three task for that webpage and the puts it in the ToPrintQueue.
And the thread then picks up a new webpage to process all tasks befor it pick up a new webpage


Question3: Which of the two programs, Program1 and Program3, has best performance, or are the
performance of the two programs about the same?
They are about the same
