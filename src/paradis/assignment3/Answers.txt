Question1: Which of the two programs, Program1 and Program2, has best performance, or are the
performance of the two programs about the same?
Program 2 have better performance


Question2: Is there any difference in which order different work tasks are performed in the two
different solutions, Program1 and Program2?
Yes the work tasks is performed in a different order in the two different programs

In program1 a loop is used to run the three different tasks (download, analyze, categorize) until all webpages are moved to the last queue (ToPrintQueue)
Each thread performs one task at a time and move the webpage to the next queue to be picked up from that queue by a thread
In a producer - consumer pattern

In Program2 the webpages are processed in a parallelStream using the forEach function. All three tasks are performed in a row on every webpage.


Question3: Which of the two programs, Program1 and Program3, has best performance, or are the
performance of the two programs about the same?
They are about the same
